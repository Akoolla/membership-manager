# Membership Manager

This project has been started to create a simple web application which allows memberships/subscriptions to a thing to be managed online. The overaching aim is to make this a simple as possible to use and run hence the plan to make it compile down to an executable jar with Jetty embedded within it and database/store which will be just a file system.

In future json api's might be exposed to provide a membership checking service for other applications, possibly using oAuth for security.

Checkout the Milestones and issues for the current plan and thiings to contribute too and the project for details of where we are at.
